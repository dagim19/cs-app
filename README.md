Welcome to the repository for the book "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective." This repository contains all the necessary instructions to set up your development environment and start working on the labs.

## Setup
To get started, follow these steps:
1. Download the Docker image by running the following command:
```docker pull xieguochao/csapp```
2. Run the Docker container using the following command:
```docker run -p 7777:7777 -v "$PWD/labs:/home/csapp/project" xieguochao/csapp```
3. Use docker and create a folder ``csapp`` inside ``/home/csapp/project``, this will be your working area
4. Use this repo as a template and clone your repo to ﻿``/home/csapp/project`` inside ``csapp`` folder:
5. Open the browser and navigate to ﻿http://localhost:7777 (password: csapp) to access the environment.
6. If you prefer to use Visual Studio Code, make sure you have the Docker extension installed. Then, open command center and find "Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container..."
